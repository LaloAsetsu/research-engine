"""The circuit/1 documents saved for quantum-sim are still what ``gate_list`` returns.

quantum-sim reads ``CircuitSteps.to_dict()`` without importing docingest, so its bridge tests
(packages/quantum-sim/tests/test_bridge.py) use documents saved in
packages/quantum-sim/tests/fixtures/bridge/, one ``NAME.json`` for each ``NAME.tex`` source.
This test is the other half of that bridge: it makes the documents again from the sources and
fails when docingest's output has changed. When it does, run
``uv run --package docingest python packages/quantum-sim/tools/make_bridge_fixtures.py`` and look
at the diff. The folder is only read; docingest never imports quantum_sim.
