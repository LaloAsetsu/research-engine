r"""docingest's copy of the wire-name grammar gives the same verdicts as quantum-sim's.

``_WIRE_NAME`` decides which marks of a quantikz drawing are skipped (a ``\wire`` that only names
a wire). It copies quantum-sim's ``_SYMBOL``. docingest never imports quantum_sim, so the two are
tested against one list of samples, kept in quantum-sim's tests
(packages/quantum-sim/tests/fixtures/wire_names.json) and run by
packages/quantum-sim/tests/test_wire_names.py against its own grammar. The folder is only read.
