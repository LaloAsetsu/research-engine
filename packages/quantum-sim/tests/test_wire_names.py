"""The grammar of a wire name, against the samples that docingest's copy is tested on too.

docingest keeps a copy of this grammar (``_WIRE_NAME`` in docingest.domain.circuits) to decide which
marks of a drawing it may skip. quantum_sim must never import docingest, and docingest must never
import quantum_sim, so the two copies cannot be compared directly. Both packages are tested
against the one list in ``tests/fixtures/wire_names.json``: a change to either grammar that moves a
verdict fails the test of that package until the list and the other grammar follow.
