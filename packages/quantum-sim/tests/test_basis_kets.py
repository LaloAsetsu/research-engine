"""The kets that docingest lets stand on a wire, against the samples its copy is tested on too.

docingest keeps a copy of this grammar (``_BASIS_KET`` in docingest.domain.circuits) to decide which
text on a wire it may leave in a gate list: empty, or a basis ket |0> or |1>. quantum_sim must never
import docingest, and docingest must never import quantum_sim, so the two copies cannot be compared
directly. Both packages are tested against the one list in ``tests/fixtures/basis_kets.json``: a
change to either grammar that moves a verdict fails the test of that package until the list and the
other grammar follow.
