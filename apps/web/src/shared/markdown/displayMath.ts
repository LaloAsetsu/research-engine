/**
 * remark-math closes a display block only at a line made of dollars alone. The converted papers
 * often close one in the middle of a line (`\end{equation}$$ where ...`) or open one with its
 * first line after the dollars (`$$\begin{equation}`, which the parser takes for a label and
 * drops), and then the rest of the page reads as one formula. The text is rewritten before it is
 * parsed so that the dollars of a display block stand on lines of their own:
 *
 *     $$\begin{equation}            $$
 *     x                             \begin{equation}
 *     \end{equation}$$ where y      x
 *                            ->     \end{equation}
 *                                   $$
 *
 *                                   where y
 *
 * Only a block that opens at the start of a line counts. A line with `$$...$$` inside, inline
 * math, code spans and fenced code are left as they were.
