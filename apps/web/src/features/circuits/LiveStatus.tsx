/**
 * One short sentence for screen readers when a reading or an answer arrives. The tables and lists
 * are not live regions: announcing 64 state rows or 256 matrix cells would drown the sentence.
 * Refusals and missing values are announced by their own alerts.
 *
 * The sentence comes from the last announcement made by the flows, not from the current state: a
 * person editing the screen clears the answer, and that must not announce anything. Two regions
 * take turns, because a region is announced when text is added to it, and the same words twice
 * in one region would change nothing. Both are always on the page, because a live region is
 * announced reliably only when it exists before its text changes.
